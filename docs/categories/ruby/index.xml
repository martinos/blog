      <description>Prior to Rails 3, the way to protect our Rails app against mass-assignment was to use the attr_accessible class method on our ActiveRecord models.
This was a less than ideal solution since our models, which represents a database table, were having some knowledge of what kind of data our webservers were receiving.

      <description>Today I was playing with the man utility and I discovered that it does not use the same strategy as ls for coloring its output.

ls | cat  Colors will be removed and there will be one file per line. Why?
Because when ls detects that its stdout is a tty, it outputs the list in multiple columns with colors.</description>
