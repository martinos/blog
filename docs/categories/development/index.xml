      <title>Simple Functional Strong Params In Ruby</title>

      <description>Prior to Rails 3, the way to protect our Rails app against mass-assignment was to use the attr_accessible class method on our ActiveRecord models.
This was a less than ideal solution since our models, which represents a database table, were having some knowledge of what kind of data our webservers were receiving.
The solution that the Rails community has found was the strong_parameters gem. The goal of this gem is to filter params at the controller level.</description>

      <description>I was working with the each_with_index Enumerator on Ruby 1.9.3 and I stumbled on a strange behavior. Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at 2 examples:
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; %w{Bob Roger Joe}.each_with_index.select{|*args| puts args.inspect} [[&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;, 0]] [[&amp;quot;Roger&amp;quot;, 1]] [[&amp;quot;Joe&amp;quot;, 2]]  &amp;gt;&amp;gt; %w{Bob Roger Joe}.each_with_index.map{|*args| puts args.inspect} [&amp;quot;Bob&amp;quot;, 0] [&amp;quot;Roger&amp;quot;, 1] [&amp;quot;Joe&amp;quot;, 2]  The select block passes one argument which is an array containing the object and the index. However, map passes two arguments: the object being interated on and the index.</description>

      <title>How Man Communicates Its Colors With Less On Os X</title>

      <description>Today I was playing with the man utility and I discovered that it does not use the same strategy as ls for coloring its output.
If we type:
ls  Colors will be displayed and the files will be listed in multiple columns, but if we send ls stdout to cat:
ls | cat  Colors will be removed and there will be one file per line. Why?
Because when ls detects that its stdout is a tty, it outputs the list in multiple columns with colors.</description>
