      <description>Prior to Rails 3, the way to protect our Rails app against mass-assignment was to use the attr_accessible class method on our ActiveRecord models.
This was a less than ideal solution since our models, which represents a database table, were having some knowledge of what kind of data our webservers were receiving.
The solution that the Rails community has found was the strong_parameters gem. The goal of this gem is to filter params at the controller level.</description>
